This was created over the course of roughly six weeks in my junior year of high school, along with a partner, Liam Mohler. Unfortunately, this is a fairly complicated project and 
it was written before I improved the readability of my code, so relearning exactly how it works and how to fix its existing bugs is an ongoing project.
In theory, it allows two players to play a game of chess against each other, if the program is hosted on a server both players can access. The game was functional,
but occasionally buggy, and of course the game itself was stripped down and missing quality-of-life features present in most online chess games.
